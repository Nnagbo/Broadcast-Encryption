# Identity-Based Broadcast Encryption System

This is a system that allows a broadcaster to send encrypted messages to a set of users. These users subscribe to the channel and their private identities are used to encrypt messages that can be sent to them. The eligible users, in turn use their private keys to decrypt the broadcast message.
